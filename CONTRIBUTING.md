## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Exercise consideration and empathy
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Use welcoming and inclusive language

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-vue-starter.git`
3. Add upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/fastapi-vue-starter.git`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Setup

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run prepare  # Sets up husky hooks
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm run test

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints for all functions
- Write docstrings for public functions and classes

```python
def create_user(db: Session, user_data: UserCreate) -> User:
    """Create a new user in the database.
    
    Args:
        db: Database session
        user_data: User creation data
        
    Returns:
        Created user instance
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If email already exists
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### TypeScript/Vue (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions

```typescript
/**
 * Authenticate user with email and password
 */
const login = async (credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AuthResponse> => {
  try {
    const response = await authAPI.login(credentials)
    // Handle response...
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error...
  }
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create reusable component classes when needed
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add magic link authentication
fix(api): handle null user in profile endpoint
docs: update deployment guide
style(frontend): format login component
test(auth): add unit tests for user service
```

   - Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
   - Get approval from maintainers for large features

2. **During development**
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as you go
   - Run tests frequently

3. **Before submitting**
   - Rebase your branch on latest main
   - Squash related commits if appropriate
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Verify no linting errors exist

## Code Review Process

1. **Automatic checks**
   - CI/CD pipeline must pass
   - Code coverage should not decrease significantly
   - No linting errors or warnings

2. **Manual review**
   - At least one maintainer review required
   - Address all feedback before merging
   - Re-request review after making changes

3. **Merge process**
   - Maintainers will merge approved PRs
   - Use "Squash and merge" for feature branches
   - Use "Merge commit" for version releases
